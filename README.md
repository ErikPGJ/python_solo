# Solar Orbiter package

This directory constitutes a git repo and Python distribution package for miscellaneous Solar Orbiter (SolO) code.

In particular, it contains code for mirroring datasets from SOAR (Solar Orbiter Archive; `http://soar.esac.esa.int/soar/`). See `README_SOAR_MIRROR.md`.

Code written by Erik P G Johansson, IRF Uppsala, Sweden.



## Important notes

This code is primarily made public only for the purpose of sharing code for mirroring SOAR data. The code was originally NOT written with the intent of being shared, nor was it intended as a standalone "package". It was originally written for local needs and as a beginner's learning experience in Python. Therefore, the code is not fully generic and does not yet fully conform to many Python conventions & best practices as the author was not very experienced in Python at the time of writing the original code. For the same reason it is not fully documented, and is not very well tested as a distribution package. Still, it is reasonably well-structured and might be useful, in part or in full.

Source code comment sections labelled "BOGIQ" refers to thoughts on future changes. Can be ignored.
